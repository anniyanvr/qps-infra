# Configuration Guide
## SCM Integration

For enterprise github or gitlab, you can declare the following global variables in Jenkins and the entire infrastructure will use them immediately by default:
</br>
  * Manage jenkins -> Configure system
  * Global properties -> Add property
      * GITHUB_API_URL -> https://$GITHUB_HOST/api/v3
      * GITHUB_HOST -> github.mydomain.com
      * GITHUB_HTML_URL -> https://$GITHUB_HOST/$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION
      * GITHUB_ORGANIZATION -> myorganization
      * GITHUB_SSH_URL -> git@$GITHUB_HOST:$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION

##### Set up "GitHub Pull Request Builder":
  *  Go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure System
  *  Specify a value for GitHub Server API URL, for example, https://api.github.com
> Note: corporate versions of GitHub should have a different value, for example, https://github.mydomain.com/api/v3
  *  Provide GitHub credentials with Admin privileges for your organization
  *  Check the "Auto-manage webhooks" param
     * [Optional] update "Commit Status Context" to a value such as qps-infra to identify that changes in GitHub PR are automatically generated by infra
  *  Save changes
> Note: be sure to test integration through the Jenkins UI

 ###### Test the integration with Github through the Jenkins UI
   *  Set Credentials -> Test basic connection to GitHub
   *  Set Repository owner/name -> Test Permissions to a Repository
   *  Set Issue ID/Comment -> Test adding comment to Pull Request
